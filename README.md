QTILE_TABBED
============

Proof-of-concept Tabbed layout in Qtile.

The layout maximizes windows without hiding bars and shows tabs for all windows
in the layout.

I developed this for my own needs and currently do not have time to make it
"complete". Feel free to let me know (for example, by [opening an Issue]) and
fork the repository if you want to develop it further.

[opening an Issue]: https://github.com/hanschen/qtile_tabbed/issues


Features
--------

- Show tabs at the top or bottom.
- Differently colored tabs for active, inactive, and urgent windows.
- Option to hide tabs if there is only one window.


Missing features
----------------

- Sideway tabs (left or right).


Credits
-------

The code is partially based on the TreeTab layout in Qtile.
